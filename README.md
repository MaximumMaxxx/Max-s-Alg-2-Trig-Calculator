# Max-s-Alg-2-Trig-Calculator

[Repl Version](https://replit.com/@MaxwellWindland/Calc)

Currently supports: Trig ratios, Inverse Trig ratios, Pythagarian Theorm

I made this to solve for and with trig ratios becuase it's annoying. Will probably get occasional updates as I have to do different things
